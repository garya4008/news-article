  <p>
    In a landmark international investigation, law enforcement authorities have successfully seized more than $430 million in cryptocurrency assets stolen by **NexVault**, a now-defunct digital asset management firm accused of defrauding thousands of investors worldwide.
  </p>

  <p>
    The investigation, which spanned 14 countries and involved cooperation from blockchain analytics firms, uncovered an elaborate scheme where NexVault executives misused customer funds for personal enrichment and high-risk investments. Following multiple indictments and the arrest of co-founders **Marcus Elridge** and **Dina Kowalski**, prosecutors announced today that the first phase of asset recovery has begun.

  <p>
    "This is a major victory for digital asset investors and demonstrates that crypto crime is not beyond the reach of law," said FBI cybercrimes division spokesperson **Alan Chen**. Recovery teams are now verifying identities of affected clients who may be eligible for partial restitution as early as September 2025.
  </p>

  <div class="eligible">
    <h3>Preliminary List of Eligible Individuals for Recovery:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebecca Owens – Brooklyn, NY</li>
      <li>Jamal T. Rivera – San Diego, CA</li>
      <li>Fatima Noor – Manchester, UK</li>
      <li>Lucas Meyer – Berlin, Germany</li>
      <li>Hiroshi Tanaka – Osaka, Japan</li>
      <li>Nina Petrova – Sofia, Bulgaria</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>More names will be released in the coming days.</em></p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Authorities urge anyone who invested in NexVault between 2022 and 2024 to register with the official claims portal at <a href="#">https://recovery-crypto.gov</a> (portal opens August 15).
  </p>

  <p>
    Investigators also noted that funds were traced using AI-driven analytics across multiple blockchains, making this case a model for future efforts against decentralized fraud.
